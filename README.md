# mealplanner

Grand aim
-- test push --
Create a meal planning app for personal use which can assign meals to days of the week.

Currently I have two functions which takes 3 or 4 days as inputs and assign random meals from a list of meals we usually eat to the days not included
as arguments i.e the days my partner is not working.

I'd like to develop this further so that a shopping list can be created using the assigned meals for next week. An extension to this would be developing some 
code which could document the state of our cupboards as well. This, in tandem, would allow for accurate shopping list creation and help to cut down on over-ordering.

Ideally this would be developed, in the long term, as some sort of user friendly app but I currently have little to no experience in that sort of front-end stuff and so will
concentrate on the back-end stuff in the short term. 

The project should be simple enough and should give me the opportunity to consolidate the learning from my university studies so far while also allowing me to get to
grips with github which I intend to use going forward.
